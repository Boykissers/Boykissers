Hello you may have found me on PT! Before interacting with me lets go over some things.

Firstly My name is kimito or Quinn whatever you prefer, I go by He/Him pronouns and I am a transgender (ftm). I am also pansexual
but more male leaning atm.

Secondly please do not be afraid to come and talk to me I probably would’ve talked to you but I suffer from social anxiety, another thing to know about me is I have ADHD and Autism with that being said I WILL get overwhelmed easily and may even become non-verbal. I apologize.

Last but not least I would appreciate if you didn’t interact with me if you support the following: DSMP/SMP in general, Dream, Proshipping, Pro-Zoophile, Anti-Furry, Anti-LGBTQ, Anti-little-space, if you can’t take a joke, basically if you aren’t a decent human being.

My current hyper-fixations are: Sharks and Orcas <3

Thanks for reading! If you wanna find out more stuff  about me come chat!
